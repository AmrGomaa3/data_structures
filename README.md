# Data Structures

A collection of C++ implementations of care data structures focused on low-level control, manual memory management, raw pointer manipulations and performance optimizations. Avoids the use of STL containers. Each module includes:

- a clean implementation
- targeted optimizations
- full complexity analysis
- test suite

Available structures:

1. [Dynamic Array](./dynamic_array/)
2. [Stack](./stack/)
3. [Queue](./queue/)
4. [Deque](./deque/)
5. [Hash Table](./hash_table/)
6. [Binary Search Tree](./BST/)
7. [Priority Queue](./PQ/)
